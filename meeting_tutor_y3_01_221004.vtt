WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
the feeding one last thing

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.470
as as have gnn is a cnn

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.050
actually to cnn's with a compete for

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.475
him

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.123
so when you go the beginning of

6
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.780
herself something right i will do this

7
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.620
because of as

8
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.590
it definitely market for your project you

9
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.390
want to something which is driven yeah

10
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.170
is their faces

11
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.330
it is not as long as your

12
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.190
with a prior points

13
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.520
a way that of this

14
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.430
so let me know come to the

15
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.930
two of them are you can come

16
00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:34.530
here

17
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.848
the person and me for doing them

18
00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:42.150
made you said so you are some

19
00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.280
not on the right

20
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.120
president and i'm doing to say

21
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.380
the

22
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.560
when you are wide shut out that

23
00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.830
yet

24
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.540
and that is one be seems keen

25
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.810
on

26
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.120
i think i've already left with the

27
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.900
only my company

28
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.910
he might come later so what are

29
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.010
we going to affect first meeting

30
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.820
a with we will often date individual

31
00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.070
meetings and group meetings

32
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.010
for the first by chance you would

33
00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.660
be here because i'm a stay the

34
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.910
same things for all of your then

35
00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.710
we do individually meeting for next week

36
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.390
or two three meetings and then once

37
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.680
in awhile i asked you to a

38
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.510
group meeting so they use show to

39
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.920
the others with you though

40
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.470
okay so you would benefit from both

41
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.210
it's useful twenty one to ones is

42
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.530
useful

43
00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.660
yeah

44
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.450
and for students and choose my project

45
00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.730
that an option to come with me

46
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.710
with a specific idea even something which

47
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.490
I didn't list

48
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.460
a which is your case you wanted

49
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.650
organization is not in my list of

50
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.310
things right

51
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.010
or other people can come and do

52
00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.540
something that i

53
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.120
oh by the my moments of your

54
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.460
own initiative like a sometimes or least

55
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.330
some topics

56
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.760
and depending on what you do i'm

57
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.930
going to have yet to make sure

58
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.785
you're choosing the right thing so i'm

59
00:02:11.785 --> 00:02:15.030
not going to ask you a what

60
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.280
is your project about have you chosen

61
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.710
a specific model or us chosen only

62
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:20.730
the general area

63
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.020
intestines

64
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.920
and yeah

65
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.780
a steep inside

66
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.730
you want to do anything with this

67
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.642
to over the platinum yeah yeah yeah

68
00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:29.580
spend some time

69
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.290
so why they let me see

70
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.430
potential applications that is hunting cut their

71
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.270
computer vision

72
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.130
yeah

73
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.380
on showtime

74
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.910
except that a car or recurrence

75
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.030
as i'm going to enemies as a

76
00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:53.647
which often use envision what type of

77
00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.110
shall do you think you're my life

78
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.730
i canal fisher

79
00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.520
in a lot of could i just

80
00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.960
ask a what what i mean the

81
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.080
by gr it didn't at a dinner

82
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.599
the other this idea networks all or

83
00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.990
her it's a typo modify cnn they

84
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.280
produce is new

85
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.010
image is this new lama used to

86
00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.470
produce movement so in colonization client lives

87
00:03:19.477 --> 00:03:21.120
matter what the much or are you

88
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.060
to economy much i can do artistic

89
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.810
then i this field changes every six

90
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.390
months or so they were very popular

91
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:31.862
on my family for the when i

92
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.710
with you said mckagan neural networks now

93
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.096
we have tossed on this which another

94
00:03:36.096 --> 00:03:37.071
not and use for the useful

95
00:03:38.622 --> 00:03:40.590
that in your case do you know

96
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.630
exactly what you want to do yeah

97
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.860
it yesterday on how noted down as

98
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.120
raising that want is to

99
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.241
that's because you i advise your name

100
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.700
of to select the possible papers or

101
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.070
is this way when like that

102
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.420
so you into

103
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.870
yost case wage on weight

104
00:04:01.932 --> 00:04:04.080
am i said you wanted in an

105
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.000
email look at my public so if

106
00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.010
somebody comes with olivia this applies to

107
00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.950
your part you look at my obligations

108
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.200
as or something point if there's anything

109
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.090
you like just two or three of

110
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.470
them and then we talk about them

111
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.450
and i would tell your if it's

112
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.580
easy to find in jeddah

113
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.700
in my obligations i know actually was

114
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.947
that in there are other things like

115
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.810
a about a nice ip which fading

116
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.360
or uk where they have it be

117
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.140
possible paper yahya so for you when

118
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.370
you have to do next armies

119
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.350
start to refine your idea besides when

120
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.730
you want to go and find out

121
00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.310
green tomatoes or papers of things that

122
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.110
you want to rethink give him a

123
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.500
summer

124
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.050
so i don't do vision of say

125
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.460
idol visual of about it

126
00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.260
of a fun one

127
00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:02.640
official national you're by yourself selfish a

128
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.620
so much articles nation is a muffin

129
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.760
there is one of the was earlier

130
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.030
right

131
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.310
i don't work on not emotionally bullish

132
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.560
of an individual faces on emotionally

133
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.710
local faces look that much of it

134
00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.640
so let's assume you chose this paper

135
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.960
two papers

136
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.141
then it might be much of a

137
00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:25.860
nice recognition

138
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.597
from few years ago is a paper

139
00:05:28.597 --> 00:05:29.130
my you have

140
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.540
the faces you need often sybil which

141
00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.390
doesn't do much processing find where the

142
00:05:36.808 --> 00:05:38.551
is said to the face and deposit

143
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:39.870
to this you still to a cnn

144
00:05:39.874 --> 00:05:43.380
it's a straightforward cnn system if you

145
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.260
do group of face recognition you have

146
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.310
a group photo

147
00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:49.740
you need to find the faces first

148
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.720
take a snapshot of their faces

149
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.790
when you give it to the cnn

150
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:56.580
and then you have it it based

151
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.370
on probably the model the news is

152
00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.440
this decision to decide if the group

153
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.210
is a hot is hockey or not

154
00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:07.890
so revised is that if you're

155
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.100
are confident that you know if you're

156
00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.451
reading or cnn is going to be

157
00:06:12.451 --> 00:06:14.880
bases are you going to cnn and

158
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.140
some base and to the something a

159
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.292
bit more complex because you know if

160
00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.730
it if you choose to you are

161
00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:23.520
presenting an aggregate to defend their doors

162
00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.325
having said this a few guys to

163
00:06:26.325 --> 00:06:27.930
choose only one cnn

164
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.660
then i will this begs you to

165
00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:33.150
explore more variations or why they put

166
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.130
out it or more you can take

167
00:06:35.166 --> 00:06:37.110
it dataset it from the better you

168
00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.490
make it work and then begin with

169
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.380
it as interfaces and got up to

170
00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.240
your said to make this work

171
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:48.869
you know my meaning that they are

172
00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:50.550
thinking why they have any basis know

173
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.559
if i were able to

174
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.370
time for

175
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:55.890
so what did you

176
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.410
hook up with another two or three

177
00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.679
papers and you can get the most

178
00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:03.285
turning sing anything i want to do

179
00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:05.580
is out there is a paper about

180
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:07.860
london waiting for a was gonna it's

181
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.040
a predicted intentions were dynamical cloth during

182
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:14.640
of human cultures and i like this

183
00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:16.800
and yeah i know there's another

184
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.250
related

185
00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.160
not different hobby i mean the sand

186
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.068
topic is hostile related and humor opening

187
00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:23.610
faction

188
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.060
i think the skills out is involved

189
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:30.787
as reinforcement learning also provides the dynamic

190
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.390
three and a heathen sammy law coach

191
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.020
had model

192
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.290
i'll probably probabilistic something like that

193
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:39.750
and our mlb dot is

194
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.380
the maximum likelihood overestimation so which made

195
00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:45.191
with do you already know because you

196
00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:46.830
use them a previous assignments

197
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.110
oh previous lectures or last

198
00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:53.893
matter with clock of you them clustering

199
00:07:53.893 --> 00:07:56.640
sitting in previous assignments know it didn't

200
00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.160
know marco decision everyone always thinks a

201
00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:02.130
lot of them yeah well our london

202
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.560
the so my advice is don't you

203
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.030
don't do the one with a real

204
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:07.530
possibility because you are the level of

205
00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:09.672
complexity do this stand them more the

206
00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.080
way

207
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:11.520
you ever open me

208
00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:12.780
polls

209
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:15.450
so it's a transfer landing you take

210
00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:18.297
an open source software don't give it

211
00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:20.730
images of people be said for them

212
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.800
cyclists get a done

213
00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.170
you can you to the classroom for

214
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.190
them so firstly about

215
00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:28.942
use and of the chef of and

216
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.460
both

217
00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.590
which require somewhere

218
00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:34.649
then they start this kind of don't

219
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:36.870
think that asking the the skeletons and

220
00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.070
then you need to those are my

221
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.610
korea

222
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.617
guy based will be so that the

223
00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.930
people in his mother

224
00:08:43.789 --> 00:08:47.520
best so be the yeah cause all

225
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.660
i want our

226
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.350
and the robots on the ice is

227
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.740
because every ever observes your skeletal give

228
00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:58.432
excalibur because the fibers get those which

229
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.110
are similar views are similar views are

230
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:03.360
different and then he creates a sequence

231
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:05.910
one two three yeah the market

232
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.860
so you have been to use

233
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.560
open positrons go live in a trailer

234
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.063
for a which they get to the

235
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.200
then custody we come of it yeah

236
00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.020
hey call for you either be that

237
00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:19.650
would like city

238
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.600
yeah to if i were you and

239
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.460
your like these i would just do

240
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.410
this paper and then if you finish

241
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.360
reading your company journalists a hundred i've

242
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.400
done everything then we get out to

243
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.457
extent if i stayed for the possibility

244
00:09:31.473 --> 00:09:32.130
was either

245
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.960
and all your how of higher than

246
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.330
that aside the to fall of the

247
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.677
here we are all accommodate him of

248
00:09:37.705 --> 00:09:41.250
probabilities the artificial agents that takes divine

249
00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.411
inspiration from the given up on on

250
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.980
top principles and the mechanisms are resolved

251
00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:49.770
in the national community was systems have

252
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.280
children

253
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:52.200
you're all style from children

254
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.030
this one was built by the for

255
00:09:54.035 --> 00:09:55.140
my research widow

256
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.800
dr modeling so this paper moto some

257
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.103
of the stages of intention better him

258
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.960
and i read your your next gone

259
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.150
basically of as the law if a

260
00:10:06.161 --> 00:10:08.070
building at our order well done

261
00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.397
and with is bit of and this

262
00:10:10.397 --> 00:10:12.805
is the general the ground outside

263
00:10:14.815 --> 00:10:16.195
if you said it was also said

264
00:10:16.195 --> 00:10:17.395
one with her better

265
00:10:18.655 --> 00:10:18.925
yeah

266
00:10:19.945 --> 00:10:23.575
the civilians dog cause situation along with

267
00:10:23.845 --> 00:10:27.325
by yourself generator models for multi modal

268
00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:30.655
category and water learning robots dollars i

269
00:10:30.655 --> 00:10:33.206
think many for who is the first

270
00:10:33.206 --> 00:10:33.805
the author

271
00:10:35.035 --> 00:10:35.665
ah

272
00:10:36.775 --> 00:10:38.155
a thorough how noting that down

273
00:10:39.115 --> 00:10:41.035
okay an exemplary

274
00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:43.973
paper reverse through my to refute it

275
00:10:43.973 --> 00:10:45.929
from i pinch reading i think it's

276
00:10:45.929 --> 00:10:47.065
it's a safe choice

277
00:10:48.535 --> 00:10:48.865
okay

278
00:10:49.465 --> 00:10:51.385
so for all four of you

279
00:10:52.367 --> 00:10:53.515
choose the first

280
00:10:54.475 --> 00:10:56.785
in another important step is the it

281
00:10:57.595 --> 00:10:58.795
have you need to have a deficit

282
00:10:58.795 --> 00:11:00.205
which is available for you

283
00:11:01.195 --> 00:11:02.785
the want to the remotely a big

284
00:11:03.415 --> 00:11:04.607
project where you have to be the

285
00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:05.245
new deficit

286
00:11:06.025 --> 00:11:07.285
or if you choose you can it

287
00:11:07.285 --> 00:11:09.325
for them going to take your you'd

288
00:11:09.415 --> 00:11:12.175
be the dataset first problem do you

289
00:11:12.175 --> 00:11:14.515
need you to be the yourself real

290
00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:16.208
shot at mobile merely things that you

291
00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:18.925
do or finding their

292
00:11:19.675 --> 00:11:22.285
the web you images of faces out

293
00:11:22.345 --> 00:11:23.155
of your sad

294
00:11:23.995 --> 00:11:25.885
but then first the can you succeed

295
00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:27.655
save on what did you choose a

296
00:11:27.655 --> 00:11:29.875
deficit which is too hard for he's

297
00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:31.765
going to be doing that's why it's

298
00:11:31.765 --> 00:11:33.955
always think about somebody else

299
00:11:35.575 --> 00:11:37.435
they fought for use an innocent with

300
00:11:37.439 --> 00:11:38.155
you can find

301
00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:40.976
they use he felt my source of

302
00:11:40.976 --> 00:11:41.365
the young

303
00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.675
and then they use it

304
00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:47.066
if that training methods that we know

305
00:11:47.066 --> 00:11:48.625
it works of the did so when

306
00:11:48.625 --> 00:11:49.945
you come to me i say angela

307
00:11:50.425 --> 00:11:52.512
they've got eighty five percent before my

308
00:11:53.065 --> 00:11:53.905
and forty two

309
00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:56.515
then we know that you can get

310
00:11:56.545 --> 00:11:58.285
a fight for somebody else uses ended

311
00:11:58.285 --> 00:11:59.605
i think as a modification

312
00:12:00.265 --> 00:12:01.255
you any sugar coat

313
00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:04.705
if he said you live in new

314
00:12:04.705 --> 00:12:06.865
deficit how do we know if parted

315
00:12:06.865 --> 00:12:08.605
ways the maximum you can have faded

316
00:12:08.605 --> 00:12:10.525
before we should be happy or not

317
00:12:12.895 --> 00:12:16.105
so for you yeah you have two

318
00:12:16.105 --> 00:12:19.315
options because i ask is nice around

319
00:12:19.315 --> 00:12:21.985
before actions yeah can build them yourself

320
00:12:22.555 --> 00:12:24.235
but in addition someone to be down

321
00:12:24.235 --> 00:12:25.585
to the guy did the what is

322
00:12:25.585 --> 00:12:27.775
still cynthia so you would be talking

323
00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:29.573
to him about taking us a yeah

324
00:12:29.573 --> 00:12:30.655
i think is

325
00:12:31.465 --> 00:12:33.265
relax and i got this yeah wins

326
00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:35.665
so that's a safe choice

327
00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:37.345
you can do a lot

328
00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:40.345
not it's perfect

329
00:12:40.795 --> 00:12:41.155
your

330
00:12:42.475 --> 00:12:43.075
no okay

331
00:12:44.755 --> 00:12:46.495
you're not cheating can

332
00:12:47.755 --> 00:12:49.458
i think she will that your pushing

333
00:12:49.458 --> 00:12:50.755
when activated it again

334
00:12:51.085 --> 00:12:52.675
to find it way for

335
00:12:54.505 --> 00:12:55.675
that for this is that is he

336
00:12:55.675 --> 00:12:56.935
spends his whole time ago

337
00:12:58.495 --> 00:13:00.715
he said a i mean the end

338
00:13:00.715 --> 00:13:01.700
of the and

339
00:13:02.665 --> 00:13:05.416
so what's good for you that she's

340
00:13:05.416 --> 00:13:06.925
still around for she should be able

341
00:13:06.932 --> 00:13:08.305
to have your hit by a left

342
00:13:10.799 --> 00:13:12.355
it doesn't she would give it a

343
00:13:12.355 --> 00:13:13.105
deficit

344
00:13:14.508 --> 00:13:16.135
the only worry that i for your

345
00:13:16.135 --> 00:13:19.015
project dental complexity is that is not

346
00:13:19.015 --> 00:13:20.995
as found that cnn

347
00:13:21.715 --> 00:13:24.235
god know that you know you find

348
00:13:24.265 --> 00:13:27.889
many libraries it's that old version it

349
00:13:27.889 --> 00:13:30.144
should be do about bio lotta super

350
00:13:30.144 --> 00:13:30.865
super easy

351
00:13:32.665 --> 00:13:33.055
okay

352
00:13:33.595 --> 00:13:35.627
that if you like it would that

353
00:13:35.627 --> 00:13:37.098
would say for next week you need

354
00:13:37.098 --> 00:13:39.145
to read a paper start to see

355
00:13:39.145 --> 00:13:41.305
to find another is yourself to before

356
00:13:41.305 --> 00:13:42.175
we ask you are

357
00:13:43.585 --> 00:13:45.752
and see if you can understand what

358
00:13:45.758 --> 00:13:47.959
did easy if you get copilot trying

359
00:13:47.959 --> 00:13:49.615
to play with his to get a

360
00:13:49.615 --> 00:13:52.285
feeling how how i a my that

361
00:13:52.285 --> 00:13:54.355
with my scales i can do this

362
00:13:56.995 --> 00:13:59.665
so for you need to read it

363
00:13:59.695 --> 00:14:01.195
this i it

364
00:14:01.435 --> 00:14:01.525
they

365
00:14:02.181 --> 00:14:03.955
you want to to save face recognition

366
00:14:03.955 --> 00:14:06.325
is the most article neutralize it gays

367
00:14:06.332 --> 00:14:07.135
regulation

368
00:14:07.675 --> 00:14:09.265
he was already some

369
00:14:10.897 --> 00:14:12.775
so she never found the vigorous other

370
00:14:12.775 --> 00:14:13.255
users

371
00:14:14.155 --> 00:14:15.985
whether you can join out the favor

372
00:14:17.605 --> 00:14:18.205
a favor

373
00:14:18.715 --> 00:14:20.725
they are you the to what they've

374
00:14:20.725 --> 00:14:22.135
heard that you need to understand it

375
00:14:22.315 --> 00:14:23.455
for the a section

376
00:14:25.435 --> 00:14:27.595
so much of a we need to

377
00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:27.895
do

378
00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:30.835
emotionally visually the why why most emotional

379
00:14:31.146 --> 00:14:32.995
hundred our faces ssh choice

380
00:14:33.595 --> 00:14:35.245
hey

381
00:14:36.535 --> 00:14:38.785
the group one that requires in addition

382
00:14:38.785 --> 00:14:39.565
to a cnn

383
00:14:40.735 --> 00:14:42.710
more bass a vending machine and a

384
00:14:42.805 --> 00:14:43.615
bagel place

385
00:14:44.395 --> 00:14:44.695
but

386
00:14:45.655 --> 00:14:47.755
i would ask you when you start

387
00:14:47.755 --> 00:14:49.900
to look at the picnic at me

388
00:14:49.915 --> 00:14:52.285
on my space how worry are you

389
00:14:53.035 --> 00:14:55.525
how confident are you that you understand

390
00:14:55.525 --> 00:14:57.462
or you know that you can understand

391
00:14:59.185 --> 00:15:00.295
let's go back to colorado

392
00:15:03.205 --> 00:15:05.245
i was going i yeah so

393
00:15:06.115 --> 00:15:11.575
essentially what i want them to compare

394
00:15:14.215 --> 00:15:16.225
have you run like in livorno

395
00:15:17.755 --> 00:15:20.215
how how well relatively good period

396
00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:24.775
colorized that compared to a national parties

397
00:15:25.015 --> 00:15:26.725
who have colorize that you

398
00:15:27.745 --> 00:15:30.805
list for the job i sat beside

399
00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:31.345
each other

400
00:15:32.365 --> 00:15:34.191
he said a paper describes how you

401
00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:35.215
can compare this

402
00:15:38.665 --> 00:15:41.035
nothing not a not a comparison

403
00:15:41.845 --> 00:15:44.005
so the answer for your opponent is

404
00:15:44.455 --> 00:15:46.465
you can only do these my advice

405
00:15:46.465 --> 00:15:47.875
is now you can do these

406
00:15:48.235 --> 00:15:50.125
listen to find the paper or somebody

407
00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:51.685
who didn't even if you didn't do

408
00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:54.115
this you only do colonization that are

409
00:15:54.445 --> 00:15:57.475
matrix they can charge or well positions

410
00:15:57.475 --> 00:16:00.271
are not excellent of measured by some

411
00:16:00.271 --> 00:16:01.675
by the gate and then that are

412
00:16:02.305 --> 00:16:05.395
subjective estimations so you can do about

413
00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:08.155
or whatever you do you should do

414
00:16:08.155 --> 00:16:08.395
what

415
00:16:08.455 --> 00:16:09.355
other people die

416
00:16:10.315 --> 00:16:14.065
radio then and have become personal in

417
00:16:14.065 --> 00:16:16.278
december sounded or and i'm finished with

418
00:16:16.285 --> 00:16:17.875
you as like as it said mr

419
00:16:17.875 --> 00:16:19.315
something about her

420
00:16:22.405 --> 00:16:23.185
covered of them

421
00:16:26.635 --> 00:16:28.047
you need to be the first i

422
00:16:28.047 --> 00:16:28.765
filmed right

423
00:16:29.935 --> 00:16:30.895
you over the first

424
00:16:32.785 --> 00:16:33.805
so yeah

425
00:16:34.435 --> 00:16:37.585
so you're for the first unit where

426
00:16:38.335 --> 00:16:39.595
it was either

427
00:16:40.945 --> 00:16:43.945
neither die and i already can make

428
00:16:43.945 --> 00:16:45.385
it on your right like i said

429
00:16:45.385 --> 00:16:47.155
to your fit on the face with

430
00:16:47.155 --> 00:16:47.695
cnn

431
00:16:49.105 --> 00:16:49.855
in some cases

432
00:16:50.695 --> 00:16:52.585
do something class

433
00:16:53.755 --> 00:16:54.385
for you

434
00:16:55.135 --> 00:16:57.192
yours is understandable that you can do

435
00:16:57.205 --> 00:16:58.405
much more languages

436
00:16:59.035 --> 00:17:00.235
you to them and money for you

437
00:17:00.235 --> 00:17:00.805
can do this

438
00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.175
hi complexity them to hide

439
00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:07.555
your project these are the say

440
00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:11.065
hi is so to something which is

441
00:17:11.065 --> 00:17:11.665
not too high

442
00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:14.875
it's almost as head

443
00:17:14.875 --> 00:17:15.775
in the past was

444
00:17:16.915 --> 00:17:18.745
my sister doesn't perform as well as

445
00:17:18.745 --> 00:17:20.935
they wanted i see the paper because

446
00:17:20.935 --> 00:17:23.331
you didn't train your system are not

447
00:17:23.331 --> 00:17:26.035
made of images and given evidence yeah

448
00:17:26.515 --> 00:17:28.015
sometimes you're going to transfer and then

449
00:17:28.015 --> 00:17:29.845
they either they retain systems

450
00:17:30.715 --> 00:17:32.088
in some cases you can use it

451
00:17:32.095 --> 00:17:34.405
i believe without the use of because

452
00:17:34.405 --> 00:17:36.605
we present of the show featuring sister

453
00:17:36.605 --> 00:17:39.235
the it is toxic chemical formula disobedience

454
00:17:40.075 --> 00:17:42.985
what in other cases like yours you

455
00:17:42.985 --> 00:17:45.355
can really just take it became more

456
00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:47.152
they've been taught to that generate up

457
00:17:47.152 --> 00:17:49.375
was uniquely agree easy

458
00:17:51.032 --> 00:17:52.645
i circled all the are you him

459
00:17:52.645 --> 00:17:55.225
it is i modified is richard

460
00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:59.155
my work without dropping that kids can

461
00:17:59.155 --> 00:18:02.065
i focus on a specific around

462
00:18:03.055 --> 00:18:05.725
view the images for example this people

463
00:18:06.175 --> 00:18:08.185
and don't look at nature

464
00:18:10.435 --> 00:18:12.173
again find the paper when she was

465
00:18:12.346 --> 00:18:12.544
and

466
00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:15.805
for you if you do

467
00:18:16.585 --> 00:18:18.745
a the intention of evening

468
00:18:19.435 --> 00:18:21.145
maybe maybe maybe not so it's not

469
00:18:21.175 --> 00:18:24.415
easy for by limited evidence am the

470
00:18:25.315 --> 00:18:27.265
and before you have the potential to

471
00:18:27.265 --> 00:18:28.795
the south korea which is media michael

472
00:18:28.795 --> 00:18:29.185
jackson

473
00:18:30.265 --> 00:18:33.020
and then the other important things are

474
00:18:33.025 --> 00:18:34.255
hispanic descent

475
00:18:34.795 --> 00:18:36.775
you will not be gets more or

476
00:18:36.775 --> 00:18:39.415
less great if you have a sister

477
00:18:39.415 --> 00:18:42.075
different forms and ninety nine percent safe

478
00:18:42.075 --> 00:18:44.965
your sister the test results is ninety

479
00:18:44.965 --> 00:18:47.665
nine hundred seventy two and based on

480
00:18:47.665 --> 00:18:49.705
the for for for demarco your project

481
00:18:50.935 --> 00:18:51.865
what matters that

482
00:18:52.795 --> 00:18:54.655
what you're doing is similar to what

483
00:18:54.655 --> 00:18:55.615
other people have done

484
00:18:56.395 --> 00:18:58.408
when the case if that a new

485
00:18:58.408 --> 00:19:01.195
measure the door eighty seven in your

486
00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:02.449
don't you to them all it does

487
00:19:02.455 --> 00:19:03.745
he said it is always find you

488
00:19:03.745 --> 00:19:06.265
say after the thirty two because i

489
00:19:06.265 --> 00:19:07.345
like is it all

490
00:19:08.305 --> 00:19:10.735
so you don't get grades for achieving

491
00:19:10.735 --> 00:19:13.765
the maximum you get rate to show

492
00:19:13.765 --> 00:19:16.855
that you are able to starting from

493
00:19:16.855 --> 00:19:18.865
scratch to use all of these libraries

494
00:19:19.105 --> 00:19:19.855
to the training

495
00:19:21.655 --> 00:19:24.475
to achieve whatever is the state of

496
00:19:24.475 --> 00:19:25.675
the art for the paper that you

497
00:19:25.675 --> 00:19:26.095
chose

498
00:19:26.935 --> 00:19:28.563
if you are too far from from

499
00:19:28.582 --> 00:19:29.725
the favorite shows

500
00:19:31.255 --> 00:19:33.711
the market will say yes or yet

501
00:19:33.711 --> 00:19:35.305
to explain why my father

502
00:19:36.235 --> 00:19:37.645
because i collins

503
00:19:38.305 --> 00:19:40.285
you know door media's or religious oh

504
00:19:40.285 --> 00:19:43.375
my my performances of cage busted decent

505
00:19:44.305 --> 00:19:46.435
oh is it because your on low

506
00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.565
confidence the subway your great

507
00:19:50.605 --> 00:19:53.575
is that important thing that i would

508
00:19:53.575 --> 00:19:55.585
we be to your many times he

509
00:19:55.585 --> 00:19:58.465
said you don't show one results the

510
00:19:58.465 --> 00:20:00.415
best result the your report it i

511
00:20:00.415 --> 00:20:02.875
say i had to this dataset i

512
00:20:02.965 --> 00:20:04.848
use this libraries i trained this with

513
00:20:04.848 --> 00:20:05.665
these parameters

514
00:20:06.235 --> 00:20:08.365
here is my best response for best

515
00:20:08.365 --> 00:20:10.555
results his legacy that live in exile

516
00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.920
you don't do these use you to

517
00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:17.530
address this problem is that there is

518
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:20.560
systems and then you have a history

519
00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.440
of achieving the final result fire

520
00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:27.040
experiment one a simple did i say

521
00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.030
his family too

522
00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.512
bigger that doesn't it has been and

523
00:20:31.512 --> 00:20:33.970
three new that us it was better

524
00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:37.150
than three a lot from nature to

525
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:37.570
people

526
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.036
so

527
00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:41.770
we want to see if you want

528
00:20:41.770 --> 00:20:43.720
a high rate your report should that

529
00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.112
the net result sexual his fame and

530
00:20:46.112 --> 00:20:47.890
money has failed to a spiritual

531
00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:52.210
i would say we please go there

532
00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:53.470
but you know they can be too

533
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.539
vague on their staff will before to

534
00:20:55.539 --> 00:20:57.910
prevent i could be seeks because you

535
00:20:57.910 --> 00:21:01.265
decide to give everything to one experiment

536
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:03.550
it doesn't mean one training he means

537
00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.220
one investigation or months ago

538
00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.140
so you're reformers that many they've also

539
00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:12.850
been to me that results in addition

540
00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:15.490
to the final including some bad results

541
00:21:15.670 --> 00:21:17.257
are you said i did is the

542
00:21:17.257 --> 00:21:18.190
result is no good

543
00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:20.560
i added a inquisitive i said he

544
00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:21.670
has my better results

545
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:26.407
they don't cause the rest would be

546
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.990
writing a nice report which is or

547
00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:30.940
later so fascinating to worry

548
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.040
the you achieve

549
00:21:34.210 --> 00:21:36.400
state though they are fish the same

550
00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.000
levels

551
00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.325
in some cases it's a perfect measured

552
00:21:40.325 --> 00:21:41.680
as you feel off as regulation your

553
00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:42.760
case is no read it

554
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:45.970
and exact numbers and for you but

555
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:47.530
then you can do the same use

556
00:21:47.530 --> 00:21:49.090
the same matrix of in the paper

557
00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:49.570
to say

558
00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:52.450
the performers his ex because i can

559
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.930
show

560
00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.610
questions

561
00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:00.040
it's all ah

562
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.320
if i do if i gather resolves

563
00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:07.540
too far away from the original paper

564
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:11.140
and it was laying by occur if

565
00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.550
what he what you explain why it

566
00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:13.600
is reasonable

567
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.538
you know you put into millions of

568
00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.030
emergency you window and it's okay you

569
00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.310
say i have some for strains

570
00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.580
it a project funded projects i'm going

571
00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:25.801
to use a on his one hundred

572
00:22:25.801 --> 00:22:28.180
the said the performance or seventy five

573
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:30.100
is that achieve some what i see

574
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.230
these shows and i'm working right

575
00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:35.680
for your specific model if it was

576
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:36.730
the one for that is you should

577
00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:38.770
worry to show that he was

578
00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.810
dad was no the percentage because

579
00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:50.920
i said that he might do that

580
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:51.910
determination

581
00:22:53.260 --> 00:22:54.310
that know something awesome

582
00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:57.700
so i can

583
00:22:58.870 --> 00:23:01.247
for example group recognition for your many

584
00:23:01.247 --> 00:23:01.780
faces

585
00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:04.570
and then you to quantify that this

586
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:06.130
issue do you do an average other

587
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:07.810
you know about that is the that's

588
00:23:07.810 --> 00:23:08.740
what it is

589
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.390
many students have done projects on that

590
00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.880
investment broker revolution

591
00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.241
hey i think once you them what

592
00:23:19.241 --> 00:23:20.440
they brought about his for there was

593
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:20.920
a day

594
00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:25.409
he's not maybe i shouldn't say

595
00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:29.020
it didn't work very hard to say

596
00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:32.620
but you can achieve these or what

597
00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:33.670
is he also something

598
00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.390
this is linda sense is to have

599
00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.579
a for you i read more than

600
00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:41.800
bought or somebody else within the month

601
00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.670
not gonna say he got later they

602
00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:46.750
struck by the beginning

603
00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:50.167
and then they let us put the

604
00:23:50.394 --> 00:23:50.710
well

605
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.860
busy will be your

606
00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.590
we have run a pantheon

607
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.700
after the look at a filmmaker who

608
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.650
started and you understand that

609
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:09.070
computationally shouldn't be a big issue for

610
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.710
your you don't need to train for

611
00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.300
weeks every four hours

612
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:16.274
it's something that's the most of your

613
00:24:16.274 --> 00:24:18.070
will to not your

614
00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.176
and you and your a fit of

615
00:24:20.176 --> 00:24:21.850
this project other think it's okay

616
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.390
yeah when he finished go train for

617
00:24:25.690 --> 00:24:26.800
larger their does it

618
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.450
unit

619
00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:31.840
basically by google

620
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.220
olive oil be lighter it's that temples

621
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.470
by month so say fifty pounds

622
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.580
for five months of using resources alive

623
00:24:42.730 --> 00:24:43.540
to be faster

624
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.260
in a google call obviously a tribute

625
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.180
another book i think it's all times

626
00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.460
lot of money is body for the

627
00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:54.850
competition up for that so are you

628
00:24:54.850 --> 00:24:57.280
just took a notebook to live your

629
00:24:57.280 --> 00:24:58.840
call them i love your code or

630
00:24:58.842 --> 00:25:00.190
then you need to run the code

631
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:03.100
rather simulations were thousands of images

632
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:04.690
a

633
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.600
if you just have brought over there

634
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.790
is that you betcha whoa what amazon

635
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.770
web services whatever you yourself are just

636
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.270
call out the for free for my

637
00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:13.690
labs

638
00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:15.970
the us

639
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:21.790
so you already have a draw

640
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.500
much less a hot

641
00:25:25.541 --> 00:25:27.490
he said that you're ready like six

642
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:29.740
or nine and thus six or nine

643
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:30.280
pounds

644
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:31.720
a month

645
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:34.450
and yet again decided one month and

646
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:35.680
to and that yourself right

647
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.950
so others not expensive means that you

648
00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:39.190
will

649
00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:42.850
eat less and less take away or

650
00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.060

for the first few months until christmas

722
00:28:47.950 --> 00:28:48.400
endeavor

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:52.480
adam

725
00:28:53.629 --> 00:28:55.510
mr change the rules either way it's

726
00:28:55.511 --> 00:28:57.116
check that out of it is not

727
00:28:57.116 --> 00:28:58.000
look at any to

728
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:59.860
see i believe

729
00:29:00.898 --> 00:29:04.090
i mean they're how set out and

730
00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.062
the student needs to keep their not

731
00:29:07.062 --> 00:29:08.620
the idea you enjoyed by this is

732
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.090
what is not it is head

733
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:23.200
go to the project

734
00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:39.550
what saw this assessment

735
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.300
so the report is for later that

736
00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.260
black york

737
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:04.104
hesitantly that

738
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:04.570
yeah

739
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:17.320
he's so humble

740
00:30:27.765 --> 00:30:28.515
you the papers

741
00:30:33.675 --> 00:30:34.905
super secret

742
00:30:39.825 --> 00:30:43.635
in somebody find in the blackboard he

743
00:30:43.977 --> 00:30:44.200
he

744
00:30:44.625 --> 00:30:47.115
nice vid lines are throat your submission

745
00:30:47.205 --> 00:30:50.175
revoked some news two screens cut subsidies

746
00:30:50.175 --> 00:30:51.645
it's a screen cost

747
00:30:52.455 --> 00:30:53.925
which is a demonstration of either that

748
00:30:53.925 --> 00:30:56.415
you that your demonstration for less than

749
00:30:56.415 --> 00:30:58.035
you are their report submission

750
00:30:58.695 --> 00:31:04.125
he's week a semester

751
00:31:04.815 --> 00:31:06.645
so weak aids what use them in

752
00:31:06.855 --> 00:31:08.835
the know it the cold

753
00:31:09.735 --> 00:31:13.155
they called three saw that and with

754
00:31:13.155 --> 00:31:14.955
nine is i'm in the report and

755
00:31:14.955 --> 00:31:17.415
screen test that it it's in the

756
00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:19.545
didn't have any clue that it on

757
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:20.775
surveys the right yeah

758
00:31:21.525 --> 00:31:24.019
but he dates phase two days later

759
00:31:24.019 --> 00:31:26.145
this but it is the any difference

760
00:31:26.145 --> 00:31:28.065
between code and the morgue

761
00:31:29.505 --> 00:31:31.635
the i shouldn't be that is okay

762
00:31:32.355 --> 00:31:32.625
ah

763
00:31:35.265 --> 00:31:37.755
the most important is that report look

764
00:31:37.755 --> 00:31:38.985
at some point you're with somebody they

765
00:31:38.985 --> 00:31:39.405
called

766
00:31:40.725 --> 00:31:42.495
can we stop you from modify the

767
00:31:43.395 --> 00:31:46.057
somehow they hope to the commission's report

768
00:31:46.057 --> 00:31:48.195
to know why would we have somebody

769
00:31:48.195 --> 00:31:48.922
wants to those on with

770
00:31:50.355 --> 00:31:52.663
yeah he's got a woman go back

771
00:31:52.663 --> 00:31:54.495
to your father was a the the

772
00:31:54.495 --> 00:31:55.665
table of results

773
00:31:56.295 --> 00:31:58.605
a service you to be so far

774
00:31:58.608 --> 00:31:59.925
to the whole so the

775
00:32:02.271 --> 00:32:04.425
is to force you to say this

776
00:32:04.425 --> 00:32:06.032
is the end of the typical development

777
00:32:06.045 --> 00:32:09.165
our to do their reports practically you

778
00:32:09.165 --> 00:32:10.455
know why you're there

779
00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:15.135
hey and as himself a good time

780
00:32:15.555 --> 00:32:17.475
the for last the folks in the

781
00:32:17.475 --> 00:32:19.005
river if you're lucky

782
00:32:19.575 --> 00:32:19.905
arsenal

783
00:32:20.775 --> 00:32:20.985
that

784
00:32:22.095 --> 00:32:24.165
okay so then there is no thing

785
00:32:24.285 --> 00:32:24.795
to do

786
00:32:26.145 --> 00:32:27.015
under hospice

787
00:32:29.055 --> 00:32:30.825
or up again catherine

788
00:32:32.235 --> 00:32:32.505
yeah

789
00:32:33.015 --> 00:32:35.385
i saw a a have notice that

790
00:32:35.505 --> 00:32:39.645
in your last year students studies to

791
00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:40.875
the sound was my title

792
00:32:41.685 --> 00:32:44.447
yet this say how put some reference

793
00:32:44.447 --> 00:32:44.745
fun

794
00:32:45.495 --> 00:32:47.745
the how replicate the paper but

795
00:32:48.825 --> 00:32:51.675
the there hum know your reference

796
00:32:53.745 --> 00:32:55.275
you find this audio equipment are you

797
00:32:55.275 --> 00:32:56.895
worried that if somebody has a movie

798
00:32:56.895 --> 00:32:59.025
though the same project is affects your

799
00:32:59.085 --> 00:33:01.605
marks or your performance a lot of

800
00:33:01.935 --> 00:33:05.012
other yeah i mean up on this

801
00:33:05.012 --> 00:33:05.685
students

802
00:33:06.615 --> 00:33:08.415
what's what's that able to see them

803
00:33:09.045 --> 00:33:12.585
rather rather i love mentor is my

804
00:33:12.585 --> 00:33:14.088
guess is you don't know if so

805
00:33:14.088 --> 00:33:15.435
that know what you'd rather do

806
00:33:16.755 --> 00:33:19.365
rather maybe the revolt a relational reasoning

807
00:33:23.685 --> 00:33:26.415
okay anyway i would say only use

808
00:33:27.255 --> 00:33:29.325
you can see the project from last

809
00:33:29.325 --> 00:33:29.715
year

810
00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:32.295
i know they give you some examples

811
00:33:32.295 --> 00:33:32.969
of putting it

812
00:33:34.665 --> 00:33:36.045
use this as a good example

813
00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:38.595
don't worry for you to has been

814
00:33:38.595 --> 00:33:40.185
done by others not others

815
00:33:41.715 --> 00:33:43.875
it's independent to of you can work

816
00:33:43.875 --> 00:33:46.275
on the same topic or they will

817
00:33:46.278 --> 00:33:47.595
make a difference because you will be

818
00:33:47.595 --> 00:33:48.615
work independently

819
00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:52.605
and you alone different numbers of the

820
00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:54.015
the numbers are exactly the same i'm

821
00:33:54.015 --> 00:33:56.248
starting to worry about my idea is

822
00:33:56.265 --> 00:33:58.575
out how to replicate a walk without

823
00:33:58.575 --> 00:33:59.445
a platform a some

824
00:34:00.975 --> 00:34:02.625
i mean citations

825
00:34:03.645 --> 00:34:05.145
not only not investment book about if

826
00:34:05.145 --> 00:34:06.465
he was about other know what you're

827
00:34:06.465 --> 00:34:08.775
referring to our as if a simple

828
00:34:09.615 --> 00:34:11.175
first you would say i'm representing a

829
00:34:11.175 --> 00:34:13.575
paper by realize you're on a dog

830
00:34:13.575 --> 00:34:14.415
the whatever you know

831
00:34:15.945 --> 00:34:16.995
and then you for this

832
00:34:17.985 --> 00:34:19.695
the digital video section of the video

833
00:34:19.695 --> 00:34:22.395
the part where you say people with

834
00:34:22.395 --> 00:34:24.735
organization and just made on a b

835
00:34:24.735 --> 00:34:27.465
c episodes and then

836
00:34:28.485 --> 00:34:31.275
if you submit everybody doesn't renounce his

837
00:34:31.275 --> 00:34:33.253
work and you never been mental realize

838
00:34:33.255 --> 00:34:35.025
it then you upload your eyes were

839
00:34:35.655 --> 00:34:36.015
okay

840
00:34:37.005 --> 00:34:38.715
if you say algorithmic over the place

841
00:34:38.719 --> 00:34:41.085
by the work by the dancing there's

842
00:34:41.085 --> 00:34:43.611
no the reason is some site for
